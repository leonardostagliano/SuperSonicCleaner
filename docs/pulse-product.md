# Pulse product design

The SuperSonicCleaner renderer uses solid graphite surfaces, neutral primary actions, readable graphs, and contextual tool guidance. Green, amber, and red communicate system conditions. The light theme has a soft grey canvas, white cards, and graphite text. Both appearances use the shared [design system](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md).

Local diagnostics, storage history, Recovery Centre, and scheduling remain available alongside cleanup and performance tools.

## Page treatments

- Home: compact CPU and memory cards with real sparklines, drive capacity, actionable care checks, recent history, and explicit routes into cleanup, protection, and scheduling.
- Cleaner: category navigation, prominent scan action, selected/recoverable totals above the results, and the existing review and confirmation flow.
- Protection: distinct guidance and tool illustrations for local malware scanning, firewall, and privacy checks. The scanner's [coverage and local rule limitations](MALWARE_SCANNING.md) are explicit.
- Storage: directory selection workspaces, contextual artwork, existing treemap/results and file selection controls.
- Performance: segmented resource meters, time-based CPU/memory/disk graphs, real transfer rates instead of arbitrary throughput percentages, and the existing process table.
- Game Mode: a quiet profile summary and one clearly labelled activation control; configuration and rollback behavior are unchanged.
- Schedules: upcoming routine dates, always-visible edit/duplicate/delete controls, and keyboard-contained template/editor dialogs with Escape dismissal.
- Settings: direct section navigation, responsive controls, and focus placement when jumping to a section.
- New main features: diagnostics recording/history workspace, Recovery Centre overview, storage history graph using comparable complete snapshots, and styled scheduling conditions.
- Other tools: shared charcoal surfaces, tailored page descriptions and three-step guidance, clearer primary scan actions, responsive tables, and consistent empty/result states across the tool routes.

## Review locally

Run `npm run dev:ui` and open http://localhost:5186/ui-preview.html. This loads the real React product with a separate, labelled, browser-only sample bridge. It never connects to Electron or changes the computer. Supported sample scans populate review screens; unsimulated operations intentionally return an error. Use `?theme=light` for light appearance and `?state=empty` for empty history fixtures. The preview entry is excluded from the Electron production build.

The exploratory concept studios have been removed. Home now offers Simple mode with three outcome cards and Advanced mode containing the existing Pulse dashboard. The view is saved in SuperSonicCleaner settings; Simple is the default. Both modes follow the selected light or dark appearance.

## Original redesign validation (before feature removal)

- `npm run check`: passed, 162 test files, 2,977 passed tests, and one upstream skipped test. Existing lint warnings remain.
- `npm run build`: passed for main, preload, and renderer.
- One repeat check encountered timing-sensitive failures in existing cleanup-receipts tests. The focused rerun and final full check passed without changes to those tests or services.
- All 35 routes rendered without an error boundary or horizontal page overflow at 1000 by 760; desktop previews checked at 1440 by 1080.
- Light-mode checks covered Home, malware, updates, performance, and settings, plus render/overflow checks for the four new routes at 1280 by 800.
- Browser interaction checks covered Cleaner scanning and selection, directory selection, schedule template focus/Escape, expanded run conditions, task reordering, diagnostics recording details, and settings section navigation.
- Graph regression tests cover timestamp windows after a pause, bounded sample counts, newest-sample retention, unit conversion, missing readings, and storage snapshot comparability across folders and volumes.
- Simple/Advanced selection is validated through IPC and persisted without changing other preferences. Browser checks covered both themes, all three goal lists, their first real tool routes, platform filtering, view persistence after reload, and a rejected-save error. Both views and the expanded goal lists fit at 1000 by 760.

Visual QA uses labelled sample data. Native scans and destructive operations were not executed during browser review. New explanatory copy uses the English fallback namespace until translations are added.
